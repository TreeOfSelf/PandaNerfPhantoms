# PandaNerfPhantoms

## Description

A very simple drop-in solution for making phantoms less annoying.
This makes phantoms show up after 7 days instead of 3. It also makes it so phantoms will set on fire if they target someone who has slept sooner than 7 days. Phantoms that have a name-tag on them won't set on fire from targetting like this though.
## Configuring

config/PandaNerfPhantoms.json generated at runtime

```
{
  "insomniaDays": 7, //how many days to wait to spawn phantoms
  "burnPhantoms": true //whether to burn phantoms when they target someone who has slept
}
```
