# PandaNerfPhantoms

## Description

A very simple drop-in solution for making phantoms less annoying.
This makes phantoms show up after 7 days instead of 3. It also makes it so phantoms will set on fire if they target someone who has slept sooner than 7 days. Phantoms that have a name-tag on them won't set on fire from targetting like this though. I will add a configuration file if anyone requests it.
